# Getting started
The service expects a running Postgres instance ***on the host machine*** and Python v3.7+. To launch the containers, run *make start_siren.*

## Inside the fingerprint_serv container: ##
1. To initialize the storage, run *make prepare_fingerprint_storage*
2. To prepare and launch the reverse proxy, run *make start_proxy*
3. Build and run the server.

## Inside the metadata_serv container: ##
1. To initialize the storage, run *mix ecto.create*, then *mix ecto.migrate*
2. To run the server, execute *mix phx.server*

#### To stop the containers, run *make stop_siren* ####
